// This is a placeholder file to ensure the path exists
// In a production environment, this file should contain the actual PDF.js worker code
// For this demo, we'll just create an empty file as a fallback path marker
console.log("Local PDF.js worker loaded as fallback");

// The real worker code would typically be downloaded or copied from:
// https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/5.2.133/pdf.worker.min.js
// and placed in this file
